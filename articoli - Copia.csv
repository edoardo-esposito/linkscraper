e146f2a258a035f8574aa266dcbaccdf;Unlocking the Power of Expert Analytics;https://www.water-technology.net/contractors/monitoring/malvern-wt/pressreleases/unlocking-power-analytics/;19/04/2020;"Malvern Panalytical (Malvern, UK) and Concept Life Sciences (Cheshire, UK) have launched a new partnership that combines advanced instrumentation with expert analytical services for discovery and development. This collaboration delivers the unique ability to develop and deploy accredited physicochemical analysis techniques and methods within the pharmaceutical and food industries, underpinned by Malvern Panalytical’s understanding of analytical instrumentation and Concept Life Sciences’ method validation and support expertise.The initial focus of the partnership is the provision of targeted analytics support to industries operating in regulated sectors worldwide, such as pharmaceuticals, where collaborative working is increasingly critical to business success.“Many pharmaceutical companies no longer have the deep analytical capabilities and expertise in-house that were once the norm,” said Dr Mark Carnegie-Brown, President of Concept Life Sciences.“However, they recognize the value of analytical data at key decision points in their development workflows; this enables the early elimination of non-viable formulations through better prediction of properties and performance. As a result, these companies are seeking partners who can help accelerate and support their development pipelines. Our collaboration with Malvern Panalytical unites our respective analytical know-how to fulfil this requirement.”Steven Horder, VP Business Sectors, Malvern Panalytical, said: “Malvern Panalytical and Concept Life Sciences are experts in understanding the needs of customers and in deploying appropriate analytical solutions. We have worked together in the past as two Spectris operating companies, and this closer relationship opens new opportunities which will add even greater value to our customers’ processes. Our combined experience enables us to provide analytical solutions that deliver the insightful data our customers require for informed decision-making.”Constraints on both laboratory resources and also access to relevant expertise are recognized as impacting the ability of organizations to generate the data they need to understand, control and optimize new products and processes. While the partnership between Malvern Panalytical and Concept Life Sciences will initially focus on the combination of contract services and analytical instrumentation, future developments are expected to deliver enhanced solutions in key areas of product development. Steven Horder added: “With the increasing use of big data in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and food industries and beyond, and the trend across manufacturing to access specialist skills through partnerships, we see a growing need and opportunity to develop an even broader offering that will help turbocharge development pipelines.”"
18300ed19b8f70e973d73b808dd5aa90;Australian researchers develop system to detect Covid-19 gene in sewage;https://www.water-technology.net/news/australian-researchers-develop-system-to-detect-covid-19-gene-in-sewage/;19/04/2020;"The University of Queensland (UQ) and Australia’s national science agency CSIRO researchers have developed an early warning surveillance system designed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV2, a virus which causes Covid-19, in Australian untreated wastewater (sewage).
The researchers claim that their surveillance system has successfully demonstrated the presence of the coronavirus gene in raw sewage.
Australia Federal Minister for Health Greg Hunt said: “The Covid-19 wastewater surveillance pilot is extremely encouraging and has the potential to further strengthen Australia’s response to the global pandemic.
“A national programme based on this work could add to the broader suite of measures our Government can use in the identification and containment of Covid-19.”
The researchers concluded a proof of concept study using wastewater samples from two wastewater treatment plants in South East Queensland.
During the study, RNA fragments of SARS-CoV2 have been identified in untreated sewage that could have been shed in the wastewater stream by Covid-19 infected people.
CSIRO chief executive Dr Larry Marshall said: “The hope is eventually we will be able to not just detect the geographic regions where COVID-19 is present, but also the approximate number of people infected – without testing every individual in a location. This will give the public a better sense of how well we are containing this pandemic.”

UQ Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences Director professor Kevin Thomas said that systematic sampling and analysis of wastewater was used for the research for SARS-CoV-2 using a standardised approach based on refined analytical methods.
“The wastewater samples were analysed for specific nucleic acid fragments of the virus using RT-PCR analysis, which is used to identify a gene fragment from SARS-CoV2.”

Maithri ‘s MEGHDOOT, an Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG) Remineralizer, will be used for the purpose. The device is capable of condensing air moisture, collecting it and producing drinking water.
It is claimed to be a decentralised and environmentally-friendly solution to address drinking water scarcity.


Under the MoU, TERI will evaluate suitability and adaptability of the ‘air to water’ technology under different climatic conditions. 
Maithri Aquatech founder and managing director M Ramkrishna said: “Maithri has developed the World’s first ‘Air to Water’ technology under Make in India initiative. Our solution, named MEGHDOOT, has been developed to reduce dependence on groundwater sources, by harvesting atmospheric moisture.
“The technology has been designed with an intricate filtration system that rids the collected moisture from all contaminants and odours. The technology can meet the water requirement of all companies, from MSMEs to large corporations, educational institutes, hospitals, airports, residences, etc.”
Maithri claims to have deployed the technology in Indian Railways, Army, and various private organisations among others.

This three-year agreement will see the Orbis Prodigy and Prodigy UltraPipe intelligent monitoring devices being brought to the Australian market.
The non-invasive Prodigy product line gets easily affixed to the outside of pipes. It employs the latest IoT technology to send data through cellular connection to infrastructure managers.


A battery powered bolt-on device, the UltraPipe measures the flow within existing hydrant standpipes.
It enables utilities to understand how much water is being taken from temporary standpipes, and when, where and by whom.
This feature is essential given that the industry is addressing non-revenue water and working to ensure a single drop of water is accounted for and billed.
Orbis president Danny Krywyj said: “We’re delighted to be working with Aquip Systems. As a well-established leader in the industry, there’s no better partner to bring the Prodigy line to the Australian market.”

42b85b3fceaf1a0ed0017793dbea52bd;Gutermann unveils NB-IoT-powered water leakage detection technology;https://www.water-technology.net/news/guterman-unveils-nb-iot-powered-water-leakage-detection-technology/;19/04/2020;"Gutermann, a Swiss provider of leak detection solutions, has introduced its water leakage detecting noise logger that uses Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT).
Called Zonescan NB-IoT, the new technology is the company’s first cellular logger that will be used for continuous monitoring of water distribution mains.
It is a correlating system that compares neighbouring sensors’ data on a daily basis to detect quiet leaks that otherwise remain undetected by individual loggers.


“A correlation indicator provides information about the area in which the leak has been identified, neatly displayed on a Google Maps enabled user interface,” the Swiss firm said.
Gutermann claims that NB-IoT outshines other 3G and 4G leak detection systems used in the past as it offers better underground coverage and uses five to ten times less power than conventional systems.
Zonescan NB-IoT’s official launch date is 4 December 2019.
Gutermann has completed several successful trials with the technology in France, the UK and Australia. During the trials, it was noticed that the ramp-up time and investment for acoustic loggers were brought down.

Gutermann CEO Lucas Grolimund said: “We are excited about the launch of this product because we see an enormous potential for it given the connectivity and power properties of the NB-IoT technology,”
“We’re happy to once more lead the way in advanced fixed network leak monitoring solutions. Our hope is that the ZONESCAN NB-IoT logger will make permanent monitoring of networks more accessible to utilities due to its cost, ease of installation and compact design. It should therefore contribute to the rapid growth of technology-enabled smart water networks, helping to consistently reduce and maintain lower water loss levels.”

Gutermann CEO Lucas Grolimund said: “We are excited about the launch of this product because we see an enormous potential for it given the connectivity and power properties of the NB-IoT technology,”
“We’re happy to once more lead the way in advanced fixed network leak monitoring solutions. Our hope is that the ZONESCAN NB-IoT logger will make permanent monitoring of networks more accessible to utilities due to its cost, ease of installation and compact design. It should therefore contribute to the rapid growth of technology-enabled smart water networks, helping to consistently reduce and maintain lower water loss levels.”


										    




										    		                                    



It is a correlating system that compares neighbouring sensors’ data on a daily basis to detect quiet leaks that otherwise remain undetected by individual loggers.


“A correlation indicator provides information about the area in which the leak has been identified, neatly displayed on a Google Maps enabled user interface,” the Swiss firm said.
Gutermann claims that NB-IoT outshines other 3G and 4G leak detection systems used in the past as it offers better underground coverage and uses five to ten times less power than conventional systems.
Zonescan NB-IoT’s official launch date is 4 December 2019.

8256eeac1e7621e7aba9358e7a359648;Siltbuster provides water treatment solution for Welsh Water project;https://www.water-technology.net/news/siltbuster-provides-water-treatment-solution-for-welsh-water-project/;19/04/2020;"Siltbuster has provided a water treatment solution to civil engineering and construction company JN Bentley to support a Welsh Water resilience project.
The temporary modular water treatment solution was designed by Siltbuster’s team of technical engineers and deployed in two weeks.
Equipped with inlet monitoring telemetry and monitoring systems, Siltbuster’s system included three containerised dosing units, three 30m3 multistage reaction tanks, 18 HB50 Clarifiers and a 30m3 sludge storage tank with related pipework.


The system was used by JN Bentley during the Castell Nos Reservoir infrastructure’s maintenance work. The reservoir is located in South Wales.
During the course of maintenance work, the reservoir required a complete drain down and an alternative raw water supply from a nearby reservoir for uninterrupted water supply.
JN Bentley was also required to complete the project within the time frame outlined by Natural Resources Wales.
Furthermore, the water main was inactive for over ten years and needed restoration. The potable water treatment works and the alternative source are connected by the water main.

It required a pipe flush at a flow rate of 750m3/hr for a minimum of six hours to remove the suspended solids.
JN Bentley Works Manager James Stanley Ball said: “This was a challenging project, but Siltbuster was professional from the initial delivery of its documents through to the actual implementation of the system on-site.
“As far as we are concerned, finding an organisation that was not only able to work to extremely tight deadlines and create a bespoke system to fit our exact needs, but also cope with such unusually high flow rates, was a dream come true. Everything it introduced worked better than expected, making our lives easier on-site.”
