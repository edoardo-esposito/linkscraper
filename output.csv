18300ed19b8f70e973d73b808dd5aa90;Australian researchers develop system to detect Covid-19 gene in sewage;https://www.water-technology.net/news/australian-researchers-develop-system-to-detect-covid-19-gene-in-sewage/;19/04/2020;The University of Queensland (UQ) and Australia’s national science agency CSIRO researchers have developed an early warning surveillance system designed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV2, a virus which causes Covid-19, in Australian untreated wastewater (sewage). “A national programme based on this work could add to the broader suite of measures our Government can use in the identification and containment of Covid-19.” The researchers concluded a proof of concept study using wastewater samples from two wastewater treatment plants in South East Queensland. During the study, RNA fragments of SARS-CoV2 have been identified in untreated sewage that could have been shed in the wastewater stream by Covid-19 infected people. CSIRO chief executive Dr Larry Marshall said: “The hope is eventually we will be able to not just detect the geographic regions where COVID-19 is present, but also the approximate number of people infected – without testing every individual in a location. This will give the public a better sense of how well we are containing this pandemic.” Sorry, there are no polls available at the moment. UQ Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences Director professor Kevin Thomas said that systematic sampling and analysis of wastewater was used for the research for SARS-CoV-2 using a standardised approach based on refined analytical methods. “The wastewater samples were analysed for specific nucleic acid fragments of the virus using RT-PCR analysis, which is used to identify a gene fragment from SARS-CoV2.”

42b85b3fceaf1a0ed0017793dbea52bd;Gutermann unveils NB-IoT-powered water leakage detection technology;https://www.water-technology.net/news/guterman-unveils-nb-iot-powered-water-leakage-detection-technology/;19/04/2020;"Gutermann, a Swiss provider of leak detection solutions, has introduced its water leakage detecting noise logger that uses Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT). It is a correlating system that compares neighbouring sensors’ data on a daily basis to detect quiet leaks that otherwise remain undetected by individual loggers. Gutermann claims that NB-IoT outshines other 3G and 4G leak detection systems used in the past as it offers better underground coverage and uses five to ten times less power than conventional systems. Zonescan NB-IoT’s official launch date is 4 December 2019. Gutermann has completed several successful trials with the technology in France, the UK and Australia. During the trials, it was noticed that the ramp-up time and investment for acoustic loggers were brought down. Sorry, there are no polls available at the moment. Gutermann CEO Lucas Grolimund said: “We are excited about the launch of this product because we see an enormous potential for it given the connectivity and power properties of the NB-IoT technology,”
“We’re happy to once more lead the way in advanced fixed network leak monitoring solutions. Our hope is that the ZONESCAN NB-IoT logger will make permanent monitoring of networks more accessible to utilities due to its cost, ease of installation and compact design. It should therefore contribute to the rapid growth of technology-enabled smart water networks, helping to consistently reduce and maintain lower water loss levels.”"
8256eeac1e7621e7aba9358e7a359648;Siltbuster provides water treatment solution for Welsh Water project;https://www.water-technology.net/news/siltbuster-provides-water-treatment-solution-for-welsh-water-project/;19/04/2020;Siltbuster has provided a water treatment solution to civil engineering and construction company JN Bentley to support a Welsh Water resilience project. Equipped with inlet monitoring telemetry and monitoring systems, Siltbuster’s system included three containerised dosing units, three 30m3 multistage reaction tanks, 18 HB50 Clarifiers and a 30m3 sludge storage tank with related pipework. The system was used by JN Bentley during the Castell Nos Reservoir infrastructure’s maintenance work. The reservoir is located in South Wales. During the course of maintenance work, the reservoir required a complete drain down and an alternative raw water supply from a nearby reservoir for uninterrupted water supply. JN Bentley was also required to complete the project within the time frame outlined by Natural Resources Wales. Furthermore, the water main was inactive for over ten years and needed restoration. The potable water treatment works and the alternative source are connected by the water main. Sorry, there are no polls available at the moment. It required a pipe flush at a flow rate of 750m3/hr for a minimum of six hours to remove the suspended solids. JN Bentley Works Manager James Stanley Ball said: “This was a challenging project, but Siltbuster was professional from the initial delivery of its documents through to the actual implementation of the system on-site. “As far as we are concerned, finding an organisation that was not only able to work to extremely tight deadlines and create a bespoke system to fit our exact needs, but also cope with such unusually high flow rates, was a dream come true. Everything it introduced worked better than expected, making our lives easier on-site.”
